    "The Bernoulli distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models the outcome of a single binary event. It takes a single parameter p, which represents the probability of success for the event, and outputs a probability distribution for the event's outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Example</b>: Consider flipping a fair coin. The Bernoulli distribution models this as a binary event where the outcome is either heads or tails. If we define \"success\" as getting heads, then the probability of success is 0.5, and the probability of failure (getting tails) is also 0.5. The Bernoulli distribution would output a probability distribution where the probability of success is 0.5 and the probability of failure is 0.5.\n",

    "Uniform distribution, also known as a rectangular distribution, is a probability distribution where all possible outcomes are equally likely to occur.

    "<b>Rolling a fair six-sided die:</b> When rolling the die, each face has an equal probability of showing up, which is 1/6 or approximately 0.1667. This means that any number between 1 and 6 is equally likely to be rolled, and the probability of rolling any particular number is 1/6.\n",
